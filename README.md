command-line application to calculate league rank table for a one-on-one/team-vs-team sport.
# league rank rules

* if two or more teams have the same number of points:
    * they are ranked the same.
    * they should be printed in alphabetical order

# project layout
* core
    * The business logic of the application lives in this module.
* model
    * The models to represent the domain live in this module.
* gateway
    * all external interaction objects(e.g. files, external APIs etc) live in this module
* main
    * cli
        * the command line interface into the application lives in this module
    * if one were to need to expose this service over REST, gRPC, as library etc, they simply add a module here that provides the interface they want expose.

# file interface(data format)
* definitions:
    * TeamResult = AlphabetName Score
        * AlphabetName can incldue spaces
    * Delimeter = ", " => comma and one space
